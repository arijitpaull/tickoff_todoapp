# tickoff

A flutter assignment; assigned by Quantum IT Innovation - by Arijit Paul

## Thought process

I named this project tickoff.
This is a todo list app where you can set your priority level as low, medium and hight. 
I kept the design and UI minimal for the ease of use and made less complications to deliver more features, while keeping the size of the app minimum.
This uses encrypted local storage package for flutter called Hive DB for accessing permanent offline storage of the device.
